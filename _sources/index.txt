Glot
====

Glot is a tool for managing a local, usually containerized Glossia server.
For more information about Glossia and its applications, see the
`Glossia documentation <https://go-smart.github.io/glossia>_`. Glot allows
users to interact from the command line, submitting simulations, retrieving
diagnostics and monitoring status, in the style of ``docker`` for a Docker
daemon or ``git`` for a repository.

Glot is one of several extant Glossia clients, the others being web-based.
